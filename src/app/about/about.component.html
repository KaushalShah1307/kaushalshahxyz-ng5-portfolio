            <p>I am a Tech-enthu, a writer, a poet who has a different perspective of looking at things around us. With the help of this blog, I would like to share my passion with people near and far. I write about my work, the things I see and how I perceive them. Thanks for stopping by.</p>
            <p>I write so that my words never fade away even if I do. I want my words to follow in the abyss of my existence and reveal the bits and pieces I have engraved within my soul and thoughts. These are not mere words but the chapters of my life I hold dear to myself.</p>   
            <p>Our FEELINGS, EMOTIONS, and THOUGHTS work in unison although they do not all come from the same place...increased mind chatter is an alarm that something needs to be addressed within your being.</p>
